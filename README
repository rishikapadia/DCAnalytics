Say goodbye to the days where you walk into the dining halls and every single piece of food seems to have a grudge against your taste buds. Simply tell DCAnalytics what kinds of food you like, and it will tell you where you should go to eat.  Using some fancy math that involves warping spacetime and traversing multiple dimensions, we determine which dining hall is serving food that you'll like the most. 

Use the *Edit Preferences* section to input your preferences, hit the *save* button, and switch over to *Analyze* to view your results.

Bon Apetit!
